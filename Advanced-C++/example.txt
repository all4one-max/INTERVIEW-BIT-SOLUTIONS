MY NAME IS SAURAV
I AM PREPARING FOR CONFLUENT
Screening
When was the last time a production incident happen, and how did you handle it
Implement pattern matching with at most one wildcard * (star)
Follow up: what if there were multiple stars
Round 1: DS/Algo
given a list of function names and the arguments they accept, implement a fast search for a function with certain args
used trie and provided full implementation
Round 2: DS/Algo
Design time based LRU cache
I was told code is not as important as coming up with the right implementation
I think I was able to come up with the right implementation. Required hints from the interviewer.
I didn't find time to code it in the end
Round 3: Design Kafka as a Service (exactly what confluent is)
prepared ppt
based on K8s
got a pretty positive feedback for this round
Round 4: Tech deep dive
what was your most challenging project
explain product + biz + technology + engg. practices + deployment
I had to give it on the go. I wasnâ€™t prepared
Recruiter did tell me before screening round about this round, but I forgot and didn't prepare for it - bad decision
Round 5: Hiring manager
questions on work and expectations
behavioural round + general know-the-work call, no technical questions
